## Why Maki?

After years of using bloated, overcomplicated project management platforms that distracted from actual work, we built Maki to be different.

The problem with most tools isn't that they lack features, it's that they have **too many**. Every notification, every unnecessary button, every complex workflow pulls your team away from what matters: **building great products**.

We believe the best tools are **invisible**. They should amplify your team's natural workflow, not force you to adapt to theirs. Maki is built on the principle that **less is more**: every feature exists because it solves a real problem, not because it looks impressive in a demo.

**What makes it different:**
- **Clean interface** that focuses on your work, not the tool
- **Self-hosted** so your data stays yours
- **Actually fast** because we care about performance
- **Open source** with a permissive MIT license

Learn more about Maki's features and capabilities in our [documentation](https://kaneo.app/docs/core).

## Sponsors

Maki is open source. If you find it useful, consider [sponsoring the project](https://github.com/sponsors/andrejsshell) to help support ongoing development.

## Getting Started

### One-Click Deployment with drim

For straightforward deployments, use [drim](https://github.com/usekaneo/drim) - a CLI tool that handles everything for you:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://assets.kaneo.app/install.sh | sh
drim setup
```

That's it. Your Maki instance will be running with automatic HTTPS, database setup, and all services configured.

Perfect for quick deployments and production setups where you want things to just work.

### Quick Start with Docker Compose

The fastest way to try Maki is with Docker Compose. This sets up Maki and PostgreSQL with a single Maki container:

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    env_file:
      - .env
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U maki -d maki"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

  maki:
    image: ghcr.io/usekaneo/kaneo:latest
    ports:
      - "5173:5173"
    env_file:
      - .env
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

Save this as `compose.yml`, copy `.env.sample` to `.env`, uncomment `MAKI_CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173`, and set `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<password>` and `AUTH_SECRET=<output of openssl rand -hex 32>`, run `docker compose up -d`, and open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

In Docker Compose, the bundled Maki container reaches PostgreSQL at the service hostname `postgres`.
If you run the API on your host instead of inside Compose, use `localhost` or set `DATABASE_URL` explicitly.

> **Important:** See our [full documentation](https://kaneo.app/docs/core) for detailed setup instructions, environment variable configuration, and troubleshooting guides.

### Deploy on Coolify

Maki ships a [Coolify-optimized `compose.coolify.yml`](compose.coolify.yml). In Coolify, create a **Public Repository** resource pointing to `https://github.com/usekaneo/kaneo`, pick the **Docker Compose** build pack (Base Directory `/`, Compose Location `compose.coolify.yml`), assign a domain to the `maki` service as `https://your-domain.com:5173`, set `MAKI_CLIENT_URL`, and deploy. `AUTH_SECRET` and the database password are auto-generated by Coolify. Leave `MAKI_API_URL` unset (it is derived from `MAKI_CLIENT_URL`; a `localhost` value breaks the browser API calls). See the [Coolify deployment guide](https://kaneo.app/docs/core/deployments/coolify) for details.

### Development Setup

For development, see our [Environment Setup Guide](ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions on configuring environment variables and troubleshooting common issues like CORS problems.

### Configuration

Maki requires several environment variables to be configured. The Docker Compose setup above handles the database automatically, but you'll need to configure environment variables for the API and web services.

For complete configuration instructions, including all required environment variables, database setup for non-Docker deployments, and advanced settings, see the [documentation](https://kaneo.app/docs/core). Advanced deployments can still use the separate `ghcr.io/usekaneo/api` and `ghcr.io/usekaneo/web` images.

## Kubernetes Deployment

If you're running Kubernetes, we provide a comprehensive Helm chart. Check out the [Helm chart documentation](./charts/maki/README.md) for detailed installation instructions, production configuration examples, TLS setup, and more.

## Development

Want to hack on Maki? See our [Environment Setup Guide](ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions on configuring environment variables and troubleshooting common issues like CORS problems.

Quick start:
```bash
# Clone and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/usekaneo/kaneo.git
cd maki
pnpm install

# Create a .env file in the root with required environment variables
# See ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md for detailed instructions

# Start development servers
pnpm dev
```

For contributing guidelines, code structure, and development best practices, check out our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [documentation](https://kaneo.app/docs/core).

## MCP Server

Maki has an official [MCP (Model Context Protocol) server](https://kaneo.app/docs/core/integrations/mcp), so AI tools like Claude, Cursor, and other MCP clients can manage your tasks, projects, and labels. Every instance ships a built-in HTTP MCP endpoint at `/api/mcp`, and for stdio clients there is the official [@maki/mcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@maki/mcp) package on npm (`npx -y @maki/mcp`).
