  title: "Best free kanban board software in 2026",
  description:
    "Free kanban boards that stay free: which are open source, which cap users, and which quietly move features into a paid tier as you grow.",
  summary:
    "Which free kanban boards are genuinely free, and where the limits actually bite.",
  answer:
    "If free means self-hosted and unlimited, the answer is Maki, WeKan, or Kanboard, all MIT licensed with no user caps or feature gates. If free means a hosted account with no card, Trello, ClickUp, and Wrike have real free tiers, each with limits that arrive sooner than you expect. The distinction that matters is whether the tool has a paid edition at all, because that is what decides which features can move later.",

        "Trello's free plan allows unlimited cards with limits on boards per workspace and automation runs, and it remains the easiest board to start on. ClickUp's Free Forever plan has unlimited tasks and members but caps storage at 60MB. Wrike has a free plan for unlimited users with a basic feature set. Asana's free Personal plan stops at 2 users, and monday.com's free plan stops at 2 seats and 3 boards.",
        "These are genuinely usable, and none of them let you keep the data on your own infrastructure. Treat a hosted free tier as a trial with an indefinite deadline: fine for a side project, riskier as the place your company's work lives.",

      question: "What is the best free kanban board for a small team?",
      answer:
        "Maki if you can self-host, because it is MIT licensed with unlimited users and includes single sign-on and time tracking. Trello if you want a hosted account with nothing to run, accepting its per-workspace board limits.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a free kanban board with no user limit?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Self-hosted Maki, WeKan, and Kanboard have no user limits at all, because there is no per-seat billing to enforce. Wrike's hosted free plan also allows unlimited users with a reduced feature set.",

      question: "Is Trello still free?",
      answer:
        "Trello keeps a free plan with unlimited cards, limits on boards per workspace, and limited automation. It cannot be self-hosted, so your data stays with Atlassian.",

      question: "What does Maki cost if I do not want to self-host?",
      answer:
        "Maki Cloud is $4 a month for a single user and $5 per user a month for teams, with a 14-day trial and no credit card required. It runs the same MIT-licensed software as the free self-hosted build.",
