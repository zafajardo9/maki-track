  title: "Project management tools that include SSO for free",
  description:
    "Single sign-on is the most commonly paywalled feature in project management. Here is where SSO is free, where it costs, and what the SSO tax actually looks like.",
  summary:
    "Where single sign-on is included, where it costs extra, and why it keeps moving behind paywalls.",
  answer:
    "Among self-hosted tools, Vikunja and WeKan include OIDC single sign-on in their free builds, and Redmine and Kanboard can do it through plugins. Maki deliberately uses email/password authentication, while OpenProject, Plane, and PLANKA reserve SSO for a paid edition or tier. Among hosted SaaS tools, SSO is almost always an Enterprise-tier feature.",

      heading: "Why single sign-on ends up behind a paywall",
      body: [
        "Because it is the feature that identifies a buyer. A team asking for SAML or OIDC has an identity provider, which means an IT function, which means a budget. Pricing pages have quietly used SSO as a proxy for company size for a decade, and the industry has a name for the result.",
        "The security argument against this is straightforward. Single sign-on is how an organisation offboards someone in one place, enforces multi-factor authentication, and stops password reuse. Charging a premium for it means the smallest and least-resourced teams get the least secure defaults.",
        "It matters more in self-hosted software, because the promise there is that running it yourself is the free path. If authentication is the part that is not free, the promise is thinner than it looks.",

ClickUp includes Google SSO from Business and custom SAML at the Enterprise level. GitHub includes SAML from Enterprise at $21 per user a month.",

      question: "What is the SSO tax?",
      answer:
        "The term for the large price jump between a vendor's standard plan and the plan that includes single sign-on. It is common enough that a public list, sso.tax, has tracked it for years. The criticism is that it prices a basic security control as a luxury.",

      answer:
        "No. Signing in with a Google or GitHub account is single sign-on for most small teams, and both are free. A dedicated provider such as Keycloak or Authentik is worth it once you want central offboarding and group mapping.",
