  title: "Best open-source project management software in 2026",
  description:
    "An honest guide to the best open-source, self-hostable project management tools in 2026: Maki, OpenProject, Plane, Redmine, Taiga, Vikunja, PLANKA, WeKan, Kanboard, and Huly, with the licence and paid-tier catch for each.",
  summary:
    "Ten self-hostable tools compared by licence, footprint, and what each one keeps behind a paid tier.",
  answer:
    "There is no single best one, but there is a short list. Maki is the best pick if you want a modern, MIT-licensed tracker that runs as one container with simple email/password authentication. OpenProject is best for classical project management with Gantt charts, Plane for a Linear-style interface, Redmine for a mature plugin ecosystem, and Vikunja for personal task management. The licence and the paid-tier line matter more than the feature list, because that is what changes after you have committed.",

        "Start with the licence, because it decides what can be taken away. MIT and GPL are open-source licences with settled meanings. Source-available licences such as PLANKA's Fair Use licence, and open-core products with an Enterprise add-on, reserve the right to move a feature you rely on into a paid tier. That is a legitimate way to fund development, and it is also a risk you should price in.",
        "Then check the authentication model. Maki deliberately keeps it to email and password. If centralized OIDC is a requirement, Vikunja and WeKan include it in their free builds, while OpenProject, Plane, and PLANKA gate comparable options.",
        "Then look at what you have to operate. A single container plus PostgreSQL is a Sunday-afternoon install and a boring backup story. A multi-service platform needs someone who will keep it patched. Be honest about which of those you have.",
        "Finally, check that data can leave. A JSON export, a documented API, or both. If you cannot get your tasks out, none of the other freedoms matter much.",

For Scrum with real sprint mechanics: Taiga. For a mature tracker with a plugin for everything: Redmine. For personal task management with a good mobile experience: Vikunja. For the lightest possible install: Kanboard.",

      question: "Is open-source project management software really free?",
      answer:
        "The software is, but check two things: whether the licence is an OSI-approved open-source licence or a source-available one, and whether features such as single sign-on, audit logs, or time tracking sit behind a paid edition. Maki, Redmine, Taiga, WeKan, and Kanboard have no paid edition. OpenProject, Plane, PLANKA, and Vikunja Pro do.",
