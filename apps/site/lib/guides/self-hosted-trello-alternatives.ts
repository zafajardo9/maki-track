  question: "What is the best self-hosted Trello alternative?",
  title: "Self-hosted Trello alternatives in 2026",
  description:
    "Trello cannot be self-hosted. These open-source kanban boards can: Maki, PLANKA, WeKan, Kanboard, Vikunja, and Focalboard, compared by licence and upkeep.",
  summary:
    "Trello has no on-premise edition. Here are the boards that do, and their catches.",
  answer:
    "Trello has no self-hosted edition, so a self-hosted Trello alternative means switching tools. Maki, PLANKA, WeKan, Kanboard, and Vikunja are the main options. Maki is MIT licensed with a backlog and simple email/password sign-in, PLANKA is closest to Trello's card design, and WeKan and Kanboard are the most minimal.",

      body: [
        "Can you export? Trello gives you board JSON on the way out, and the tool you move to should offer the same courtesy. PLANKA currently does not have an export feature, which is why our importer talks to its API directly.",

        "Who runs it in six months? Every self-hosted board needs backups, TLS, and updates. Prefer the smallest thing that does the job: one container and PostgreSQL is a very different commitment from a multi-service platform.",

      heading: "Getting your Trello boards out",
      body: [
        "Trello exports each board to JSON from the board menu, including cards, lists, labels, members, and comments. Attachments are links rather than files, so download them separately if they matter.",
        "From there it is a scripting job against the target tool's API. Maki has a documented public API and per-project JSON import, so a board of a few hundred cards is an afternoon. Import into a scratch project first and check assignee matching, which usually happens by email address.",

      question: "Can Trello be self-hosted?",
      answer:
        "No. Trello is an Atlassian cloud product with no on-premise or self-hosted edition. Running a Trello-style board on your own server means using a different tool.",

      question: "What is the closest open-source tool to Trello?",

        "PLANKA is closest in card design and interaction. Maki keeps the same simplicity and adds a backlog, workflows, roles, and time tracking under the MIT license.",

      question: "Is there a free self-hosted kanban board?",
      answer:
        "Several. Maki, WeKan, and Kanboard are MIT licensed and free to self-host with no user limits or feature gates. Vikunja is free under AGPLv3 with a paid Pro add-on for some features.",

      question: "How do I import Trello boards into Maki?",
      answer:
        "Export the board to JSON from Trello, then create the tasks through Maki's public API or its per-project JSON import. There is no one-click importer yet. If you want one, open an issue on GitHub, since import work is prioritised by demand.",
