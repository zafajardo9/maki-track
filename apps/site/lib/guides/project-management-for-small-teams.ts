  description:
    "What actually matters when picking a project management tool for a team of two to twenty: pricing shape, adoption, and how much tool you have to administer.",
  summary:
    "Pricing shape, adoption, and admin overhead matter more than feature lists below twenty people.",
  answer:
    "For a team under twenty people, the deciding factors are pricing shape, whether people will actually update it, and how much administration it needs. Maki is a good fit if you want an open-source tracker that is free to self-host or $5 per user a month managed. Trello is the easiest hosted start, Basecamp's flat rate is the best deal once you pass about fifteen people, and Linear is the most polished if budget is not the constraint.",

      body: [
        "Adoption beats features. A tool that everyone updates on a Tuesday afternoon is worth more than a complete one that only the manager touches. Judge it by how quickly a new person can find their work without being trained.",
        "Pricing shape matters more than price. Per-seat pricing punishes growth and makes people share logins. Flat rates favour bigger teams. Free self-hosting makes headcount irrelevant and trades money for an hour of setup and occasional maintenance.",
        "Administration is a hidden cost. Some tools need an owner: schemes to configure, automations to maintain, a database somebody built in Notion. At ten people, nobody has that time.",
        "Check the exit before the entrance. An export function and a documented API turn a tool choice into a reversible decision.",

      body: [
        "Pick two tools, not five. Move one real project into each, with the actual tasks your team has this week, not a demo project. Give it five working days.",
        "At the end, ask three questions: did people update it without being reminded, could a new joiner find their work unaided, and how much would it cost at double the headcount. That usually settles it.",
        "If both fail, the problem is often not the tool. Three columns and a weekly review beat any product if the team has not agreed how work moves.",

      question:
        "What is the cheapest project management tool for a small team?",
      answer:
        "Self-hosting an open-source tool such as Maki, Kanboard, or WeKan costs only a server, typically a few dollars a month for any number of people. Among hosted options, Maki Cloud is $4 a month for one user and $5 per user a month for teams, and Basecamp's flat rate wins once you pass roughly fifteen people.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do small teams need project management software at all?",
      answer:
        "Below about five people, a shared board and a weekly review is usually enough, and that is exactly what a simple tracker gives you. What small teams do not need is a tool that requires configuration before it is useful.",
    },
    {
      question: "Should a small team self-host?",
      answer:
        "Only if someone is willing to own backups and updates, which is perhaps ten minutes a month once it is running. If nobody wants that job, pay for a managed plan. Both are legitimate, and with an open-source tool you can change your mind later.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do we migrate later if we choose wrong?",
      answer:
        "Check for an export and an API before you start. Maki exports each project to JSON and has a documented public API, so moving in or out is a scripting job rather than a rewrite of your history.",
