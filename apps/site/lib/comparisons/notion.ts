    "Notion is a wonderful place to write and a fiddly place to track work. Maki is a purpose-built tracker you can self-host, so nobody has to maintain the board that runs your team.",
  verdict:
    "Maki is an open-source, MIT-licensed alternative to Notion for project tracking specifically. Where Notion asks you to build a task database and keep it working, Maki ships boards, backlog, workflow columns, roles, and time tracking as product features. Maki is not a replacement for Notion's docs and wiki.",

  honestNote:
    "Notion is excellent at what it is: a flexible workspace for documents, wikis, and lightweight databases. If your team lives in written docs and the task list is a side-effect of that, stay in Notion. Maki is worth it when the tracking part has become the point and the database keeps getting in the way.",

      question: "Is there an open-source alternative to Notion?",
      answer:
        "For documents and wikis, look at AppFlowy, Outline, Docmost, or AnyType. For the project-tracking half of Notion, Maki is MIT licensed, self-hostable, and purpose-built for boards and backlogs.",

    {
      question: "Can Notion be self-hosted?",
      answer:
        "No. Notion is cloud-only, and its Enterprise tier adds controls rather than an installable build. Self-hosting requires a different tool.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is Notion good for project management?",
      answer:
        "It works, but you build and maintain it. Boards, sprints, and rollups are database views you assemble yourself, and they drift as the team grows. A dedicated tracker gives you the same views without the upkeep.",

      answer:
        "Notion is free for personal use with limits on uploads, history, and guests. Plus is $10 per member a month and Business is $20, where SAML single sign-on first appears. Maki uses email/password sign-in on every build.",
