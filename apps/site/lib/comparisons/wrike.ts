    "Maki is an open-source, self-hostable Wrike alternative with no user bands, simple email/password authentication, and free self-hosting under the MIT license.",

  heading: "The open-source Wrike alternative",
  subheading:
    "Wrike prices in user bands and sells the good parts by tier. Maki is one product, free to self-host, with every feature in every build.",
  verdict:
    "Maki is an open-source, MIT-licensed alternative to Wrike that runs on your own infrastructure at no cost. Wrike is cloud-first, priced per user from $10 a month with plan-specific user ranges, and aimed at larger operations teams. Maki trades Wrike's resource management and proofing for a simpler tracker you own.",

  honestNote:
    "Wrike is built for larger marketing, professional services, and operations teams that need request forms, proofing, resource allocation, and time-and-budget reporting in one place. Maki has none of that. If you are running billable client work at scale, Wrike is the more complete product.",

      question: "Can Wrike be self-hosted?",
      answer:
        "No. Wrike is delivered as SaaS with regional data-centre options and enterprise security controls, but there is no on-premise installation for general customers.",

      question: "What does Wrike cost?",
      answer:
        "Wrike has a free plan, then Team at $10 per user a month for 2 to 15 users and Business at $25 per user a month for 5 to 200 users, with Pinnacle and Apex quoted by sales.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is there an open-source alternative to Wrike?",
      answer:
        "Maki and OpenProject are the two most often suggested. OpenProject is closer to Wrike in scope, with Gantt charts and cost reporting. Maki is closer if you want a light tracker your team will actually keep updated.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does Maki do resource management?",
      answer:
        "No. Maki tracks time spent per task and shows workload through boards and assignees, but it has no capacity planning, allocation, or billing model.",
