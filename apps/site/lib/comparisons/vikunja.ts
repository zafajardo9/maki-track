    "Vikunja is a lovely self-hosted to-do app, and its Pro tier keeps some features for paying self-hosters. Maki is team-first, MIT licensed, and has no Pro tier at all.",
  verdict:
    "Maki and Vikunja are both open source and self-hostable, but they aim at different users. Vikunja is a personal and small-team task manager under AGPLv3, with a paid Vikunja Pro add-on for self-hosters that includes features such as time tracking and audit logs. Maki is MIT licensed, team-oriented, and ships every feature in the free build.",

  honestNote:
    "Vikunja is delightful for personal task management: fast, small, with list, table, gantt, and calendar views and a genuinely nice mobile experience. If you mostly manage your own work and occasionally share a list, Vikunja is probably the better fit, and its cloud is priced kindly.",

      question: "Is Vikunja completely free to self-host?",
      answer:

      question: "Vikunja or Maki for a team?",
      answer:
        "Maki is built around workspaces, projects, and roles, with backlog planning and time tracking in the free build, so it fits teams better. Vikunja is stronger for individuals and its calendar and list views are more developed.",

    {
      question: "Do both support single sign-on?",
      answer:
        "Yes, both support OIDC providers on their self-hosted builds at no cost, which is not something every tool in this category can say.",
    },
    {
      question: "Which is easier to run?",
      answer:
        "Both are simple. Vikunja is a Go binary with an optional embedded database, which is marginally easier for a single-user install. Maki is a container plus PostgreSQL, and ships a Helm chart for Kubernetes.",
