  subheading:
    "Taiga is built around Scrum and Kanban done properly, sprints, story points, and all. Maki is for teams who want to plan and ship without adopting a methodology first.",
  verdict:
    "Maki is a simpler, MIT-licensed alternative to Taiga. Both are open source and self-hostable. Taiga is MPL-2.0 and organised around agile ceremonies, with sprints, story points, and burndown charts. Maki keeps a board, a backlog, workflow columns, and time tracking, and leaves the methodology to you.",

  honestNote:
    "Taiga is a well-established agile tool with proper sprint management, story points, burndown charts, and an epics model, and it is free to self-host under MPL-2.0. If your team genuinely runs Scrum, Taiga supports that far better than Maki does.",

      question: "Is Taiga free and open source?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Taiga is open source under MPL-2.0 and free to self-host with no user limits. Taiga also offers a cloud with a free tier and paid support options.",

      question: "Taiga or Maki?",
      answer:
        "Taiga if you run Scrum with sprints, story points, and burndowns. Maki if you want a board and backlog without ceremony, plus time tracking and single sign-on in a smaller install.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does Maki support sprints?",
      answer:
        "Not as a first-class concept. Maki has backlog planning and workflow columns, which many teams use to run iterations informally, but there are no sprint objects, story points, or burndown charts.",
    },
    {
      question: "Which is easier to self-host?",
      answer:
        "Maki. It is a single container plus PostgreSQL, deployable with Docker Compose or the official Helm chart. Taiga's standard deployment runs several coordinated services.",
