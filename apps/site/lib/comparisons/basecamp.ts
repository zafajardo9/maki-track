    "Maki is an open-source, self-hostable Basecamp alternative with real boards and a backlog, free to run yourself under the MIT license.",

  subheading:
    "Basecamp is calm, opinionated, and hosted by Basecamp. Maki is calm, opinionated, and hosted by you, with a board and backlog built for shipping software.",
  verdict:
    "Maki is an open-source, MIT-licensed alternative to Basecamp that you can run on your own server for free. Basecamp charges a flat monthly fee with no per-user pricing, which is a genuinely good deal for larger teams, but it is cloud-only and organised around message boards and to-do lists rather than a kanban board and backlog.",

  honestNote:
    "Basecamp's flat pricing and its all-in-one approach to client work, messages, docs, and check-ins are hard to beat if that is how your company communicates. Maki has no message boards, no campfire chat, and no client access. If Basecamp is your intranet, keep it.",

      question: "Can Basecamp be self-hosted?",
      answer:
        "Not the current version. Basecamp has been a hosted product since Basecamp 3, and the older self-installable Basecamp Classic is long retired. Once On-Premise was 37signals' answer for self-hosting Campfire and similar apps, not for Basecamp itself.",

    {
      question: "What does Basecamp cost?",
      answer:
        "Basecamp is flat-rate rather than per user: a free tier, then Freelancer at $25 a month, Studio at $59, Pro at $100, and Unlimited at $300 a month billed annually, with everyone on the account included.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is there an open-source Basecamp alternative?",
      answer:
        "Maki, Leantime, OpenProject, and Taiga are the usual open-source options. Maki is the closest if what you want is a fast board and backlog. Leantime is closer if you want goals and light client-facing structure.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does Maki have Basecamp's message boards?",
      answer:
        "No. Maki has task comments, notifications, and integrations with Slack, Discord, and Telegram, but no standalone message board or group chat. It assumes your team already talks somewhere else.",
