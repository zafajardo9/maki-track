  description:
    "Maki is an open-source, self-hostable alternative to GitHub Projects for teams that need a tracker outside a single repository host.",
  summary: "A tracker for the work that does not belong in a repository.",
  heading: "The self-hostable alternative to GitHub Projects",
  subheading:
    "GitHub Projects is free and fine, right up until you need non-engineering work, time tracking, or a tracker that outlives your GitHub plan. Maki is a standalone board you own.",
  verdict:
    "Maki is an open-source, MIT-licensed alternative to GitHub Projects for teams whose work does not all live in GitHub issues. GitHub Projects is included with GitHub and excellent for repository-bound work, but it has no time tracking, no workspace roles outside GitHub's own, and it ties your planning history to your GitHub account.",

    license: "MIT, and independent of any repository host",
    hosting: "Self-host anywhere, or EU-hosted cloud",

  honestNote:
    "For a team whose work is entirely code in GitHub repositories, GitHub Projects is hard to argue with: it is included in your plan, it lives next to the pull requests, and the automation between issues and boards is genuinely good. Maki makes sense when planning has outgrown the repository.",

    {
      question: "Is GitHub Projects free?",
      answer:
        "Yes, Projects is included with GitHub, including the Free plan. GitHub's paid plans are $4 per user a month for Team and from $21 for Enterprise, which is where SAML SSO and advanced auditing appear.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use GitHub Projects for non-engineering work?",
      answer:
        "You can, but every item is a repository issue or a draft item, so non-code work either clutters a repo or lives as drafts with fewer features. A standalone tracker avoids that trade.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does Maki integrate with GitHub?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Maki has GitHub and Gitea integrations connecting repository activity to tasks, plus outgoing webhooks, a public API, and an MCP server if you want AI agents to work with your board.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can GitHub Projects be self-hosted?",
      answer:
        "Only as part of GitHub Enterprise Server, which is a licensed on-premise install of GitHub itself. Maki self-hosts on its own with Docker and PostgreSQL, free under the MIT license.",
