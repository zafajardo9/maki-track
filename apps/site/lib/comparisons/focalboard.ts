  verdict:
    "Maki is an actively maintained, MIT-licensed alternative to Focalboard. Mattermost stopped bundling the Focalboard plugin in 2023 and the standalone project moved to community maintenance, with the plugin continuing separately as Mattermost Boards. Maki offers a comparable self-hosted board with regular releases, email/password sign-in, and a documented API.",

    "If you already run Mattermost, the maintained Boards plugin keeps your tasks next to your conversations, and that adjacency is worth a lot. Focalboard's card and property model is also flexible in a Notion-like way that Maki deliberately does not copy.",

      answer:

      question: "What should I use instead of Focalboard?",
      answer:
        "For a maintained self-hosted board, Maki, PLANKA, WeKan, and Vikunja are the usual choices. Maki is MIT licensed, uses email/password sign-in, and adds backlog planning and time tracking.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I move my Focalboard data to Maki?",
      answer:
        "There is no dedicated importer. Focalboard exports boards as archive files, and Maki has a public API and per-project JSON import, so a scripted migration is possible. Open a GitHub issue if you want this supported properly.",

      question: "Does Maki need Mattermost or another chat tool?",
      answer:
        "No. Maki is standalone. It can post notifications into Slack, Discord, or Telegram, but nothing requires them.",
