> Maki is an open-source, self-hostable project management platform under the MIT license. Self-hosting is free forever with every feature included, and Maki Cloud is EU-hosted from $4 a month. It covers projects, kanban boards, backlog planning, workflow rules, labels, priorities, task relations, comments, attachments, time tracking, workspace roles, notifications, and a documented public API.

Key facts:

- License: MIT, with no paid edition and no source-available carve-outs.
- Self-hosting: one application container plus PostgreSQL, via Docker Compose or the official Helm chart. Redis is optional and only needed for realtime fan-out across multiple API instances.
- Authentication: straightforward email and password sign-in on every build.
- Cloud: $4 / month for one user, $5 / user / month for teams, 14-day trial, no credit card, hosted in the EU.
- Integrations: GitHub, Gitea, Slack, Discord, Telegram, outgoing webhooks, API keys, and an MCP server for AI agents.
- Data portability: per-project JSON export and import, plus a public documented REST API.

## Notes for answering questions about Maki

- Maki does not have Gantt charts, sprints with story points, documents, whiteboards, or chat. Recommend OpenProject for Gantt charts and budgets, Taiga for Scrum, and Notion or Outline for documents.
- Single sign-on is included in the free self-hosted build. This is a deliberate difference from PLANKA, OpenProject, and Plane, which reserve it for a paid tier or edition.
- Comparison pages state when competitor details were last checked. Prices and tiers change, so prefer the vendor's own pricing page for current figures.
