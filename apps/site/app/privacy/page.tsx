                This policy describes how the Maki website (kaneo.app) and the
                managed Maki Cloud service (cloud.kaneo.app) handle your data.
                The service is operated by Andrej Acevski (sole proprietor,
                Macedonia), referred to as “we” below. If you self-host Maki,
                this policy does not apply: your instance is under your control
                and we receive no data from it.

                When you create a Maki Cloud account we store your name, email
                address, and, if you sign in with GitHub, Google, or Discord,
                the basic profile information those providers share (such as
                your avatar). We never receive your passwords for those
                providers.

                Payments for Maki Cloud are processed by Creem (creem.io) acting

                details under its own privacy policy; we never see or store your
                card number. We receive only what is needed to manage your

                Standard server logs (IP address, request time, user agent) are
                kept briefly for security and troubleshooting. Application
                errors are reported to Sentry (EU region) and may include
                technical context about the request that failed; we configure
                error reporting not to include personal data by default.
