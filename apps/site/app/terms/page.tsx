                These terms govern your use of the managed Maki Cloud service at
                cloud.kaneo.app, operated by Andrej Acevski (sole proprietor,
                Macedonia), referred to as “we” or “us”. By creating an account
                you agree to these terms. The open-source Maki software itself
                is separately licensed under the MIT license, and self-hosted
                installations are not covered by these terms.

            <Section title="1. The service">
              <p>
                Maki Cloud is a hosted version of the open-source Maki project
                management application. We operate the infrastructure, apply
                updates, and maintain backups so you don’t have to. We may
                improve or modify the service over time; we will not materially
                reduce core functionality of a paid plan during a paid period.
              </p>
            </Section>

            <Section title="2. Accounts">
              <p>
                You must provide accurate information and keep your account
                credentials secure. You are responsible for activity under your
                account and for content your workspace members create. You must
                be at least 16 years old to use the service.
              </p>
            </Section>

            <Section title="3. Plans, billing, and trials">
              <p>
                Current prices are shown during signup. Paid plans start with a
                14-day free trial. Payments are processed by Creem as merchant
                of record. Creem is the seller of record and handles payment
                collection, invoices, and applicable taxes. Subscriptions renew
                automatically (monthly or annually) until cancelled. You can
                cancel anytime; your plan remains active until the end of the
                paid period. If you believe a charge is in error, contact us
                within 14 days and we will work with you on a refund where
                appropriate.
              </p>
              <p>
                Accounts created before paid plans were introduced keep free
                access for at least 12 months from that introduction, and we
                will give at least 6 months notice before their terms change.
              </p>
            </Section>

            <Section title="4. Your content">
              <p>
                Content you create in Maki Cloud belongs to you. You grant us
                only the rights needed to host, back up, and display it to you
                and the people you share it with. You can export your data at
                any time, including for migration to a self-hosted installation.

            <Section title="5. Acceptable use">
              <p>
                Don’t use the service to break the law, infringe others’ rights,
                distribute malware, send spam, or attempt to disrupt the service
                or access other customers’ data. We may suspend accounts that
                do, after notice where practical.

            <Section title="6. Availability and support">
              <p>
                We aim for high availability and maintain monitoring and daily
                backups, but the service is provided without a formal uptime
                guarantee (SLA). Support is provided by email at{" "}

            <Section title="7. Disclaimer and liability">
              <p>
                The service is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind,
                to the extent permitted by law. Our total liability for any
                claims arising from the service is limited to the amount you
                paid us in the 12 months before the claim. We are not liable for
                indirect or consequential damages, or for loss of data you have
                not given us a reasonable opportunity to help recover.
              </p>

            <Section title="8. Termination">
              <p>
                You may delete your account at any time. We may terminate or
                suspend accounts that violate these terms. If we ever
                discontinue the service, we will give at least 6 months notice
                and provide a data export path. The open-source, self-hosted
                edition of Maki will always remain available.
              </p>

            <Section title="9. Changes and governing law">
              <p>
                We may update these terms; material changes will be announced to
                registered users by email at least 30 days in advance. These
                terms are governed by the laws of Macedonia, without affecting
                mandatory consumer protections of your country of residence.
