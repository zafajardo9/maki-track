## Code of Conduct

We want everyone to feel welcome here. Please be respectful and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/).

## Getting Started

### What You'll Need

- **Node.js** (24 or newer)
- **pnpm** (we use this instead of npm/yarn)
- **Git**
- **Docker** (optional, for testing full deployments)

### Setting Up Your Dev Environment

1. **Fork and clone the repo**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/maki.git
cd maki
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the repository root for server configuration. The web app includes localhost development defaults; put local Vite overrides such as `VITE_API_URL` in `apps/web/.env.local`. See [ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md](ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md) for the required variables and examples.

4. **Start everything up**:
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This starts both the API (port 1337) and web app (port 5173). Both will automatically reload when you make changes.

> **Tip**: The web app at http://localhost:5173 will automatically connect to the API at http://localhost:1337

> **Need help with setup?** See our [Environment Setup Guide](ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions and troubleshooting tips.

## Making Your First Contribution

### Finding Something to Work On

- **Browse [open issues](https://github.com/usekaneo/kaneo/issues)** - look for "good first issue" labels
- **Check our [Discord](https://discord.gg/rU4tSyhXXU)** - we often discuss features and bugs there
- **Found a bug?** Feel free to fix it and open a PR

### The Process

1. **Create a branch** for your work:
```bash
git checkout -b fix/whatever-youre-fixing
# or
git checkout -b feat/cool-new-feature
```

2. **Make your changes** and test them locally (`pnpm test` for unit tests; `pnpm test:integration` for API integration tests with PostgreSQL)

3. **Commit using conventional commits**:
```bash
git commit -m "fix: resolve calendar date selection bug"
git commit -m "feat: add bulk task operations"
git commit -m "docs: update deployment guide"
```

4. **Push and create a PR**:
```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

Then open a pull request on GitHub with a clear description of what you changed and why.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use **Biome** for formatting and linting. Before you commit:

```bash
pnpm run lint
```

This will check and automatically fix formatting issues. Most editors can auto-format on save if you install the Biome extension.

### Commit Messages

We use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to keep our history clean:

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `refactor:` - Code changes that don't add features or fix bugs
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

### Localization (i18n)

Maki uses [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) with [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) in the web app. We want user-facing copy to stay consistent, translatable, and easy to maintain.

#### Approach

- Use translation keys for all user-facing strings instead of hardcoded copy
- In React components, call `t("namespace:key.path")` from `useTranslation()`
- Translation files live in [`i18n/`](./i18n) and use locale-style filenames such as `en-US.json` and `de-DE.json`
- [`i18n/en-US.json`](./i18n/en-US.json) is the source of truth for translation keys
- Locale selection comes from the signed-in user's saved preference when available, otherwise from the browser locale

#### i18n commands

The root `package.json` includes scripts to keep locale files in sync:

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `pnpm i18n:check [locale]` | Compares `en-US.json` with the other locale files and reports missing or extra keys. You can filter by locale, for example `pnpm i18n:check de-DE`. |
| `pnpm i18n:check:fix [locale]` | Adds missing keys to other locale files using the English source text from `en-US.json`. |
| `pnpm i18n:report` | Scans `.ts` and `.tsx` files in the React app and reports missing keys, unused locale keys, and dynamic translation calls that static analysis cannot verify. |
| `pnpm i18n:report:fix` | Removes unused keys from `en-US.json` and the other locale files. |
| `pnpm i18n:schema` | Generates [`i18n/schema.json`](./i18n/schema.json) from `en-US.json` for editor and tooling validation. |

#### Adding a new locale

1. Create a new file in [`i18n/`](./i18n) using a locale code filename such as `fr-FR.json`.
2. Copy [`i18n/en-US.json`](./i18n/en-US.json) and translate the values.
3. Register the locale in [`i18n/resources.ts`](./i18n/resources.ts) by updating `supportedLocales` and `resources`.
4. If the locale should be selectable in the UI, add it to the language picker in [`apps/web/src/routes/_layout/_authenticated/dashboard/settings/account/preferences.tsx`](./apps/web/src/routes/_layout/_authenticated/dashboard/settings/account/preferences.tsx).
5. Run `pnpm i18n:check`, `pnpm i18n:report`, and `pnpm i18n:schema` before opening your PR.

#### Adding translations

1. Add the new key to [`i18n/en-US.json`](./i18n/en-US.json) first.
2. Use it in code with a static key:

```tsx
const { t } = useTranslation();

return <p>{t("common:actions.close")}</p>;
```

3. Use interpolation for dynamic values instead of concatenating translated strings:

```tsx
t("projects:greeting", { name: userName });
```

4. Keep translation keys static. Calls like `t(someVariable)` or ``t(`tasks:${key}`)`` cannot be validated by the i18n report and will be flagged.

#### Translation key conventions

- Use namespaces at the top level such as `common`, `settings`, and `tasks`
- Use dot notation inside each namespace, for example `settings.preferencesPage.title`
- Keep keys descriptive and stable
- Put widely shared labels in `common`
- Group feature-specific keys under the feature or component they belong to

#### Contribution notes

- If you change UI copy, update the locale files in the same PR
- If you remove or rename translation keys, run `pnpm i18n:report:fix` to keep locale files clean
- If a locale is not fully translated yet, leaving the English source text as a placeholder is fine

## Using AI

You are welcome to use AI tools to help you contribute, and we as maintainers do the same. They are useful for research, writing code or tests, and exploring unfamiliar parts of the project. Two boundaries apply to every contribution.

### Speak for yourself

Write issues, pull request descriptions, and review replies in your own words. Clear, imperfect writing is better than a generated explanation that is longer than necessary or does not accurately describe the contribution.

### Think for yourself

Understand and take responsibility for every change you submit. Before requesting review, reproduce the problem, reduce the solution to its necessary scope, and verify the behavior yourself. You should be able to explain the design decisions, tradeoffs, and tests without relying on an AI-generated answer.

AI output is not evidence that a change is correct. Include meaningful regression coverage for behavior changes and keep unrelated or speculative work out of the pull request.

Automated review can be part of preparing an open pull request. Address relevant bot feedback and stabilize the change before requesting review from a maintainer.

Maintainers may close a pull request without a detailed implementation review when its description is inaccurate, its scope exceeds the linked issue, important behavior is untested, or the author cannot explain and validate the submitted work. Review feedback identifies problems; it does not replace the contributor's own investigation and validation.
